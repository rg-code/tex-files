Latex Documents and templates

I have made some modifcation to meet my needs, all the templates are open source and contain credits to original licesnes.
Please feel free to use and modify any of the cls and tex files by keeping the licensing info intact.

If you are using Debian based machine I recommend tex maker or gummi for editing tex documents.

> How to install gummi - ``` "sudo apt-get install gummi" ``` (Recommended)

> How to install texmaker for a debian machine - Download .deb file from [here](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html)

Both Resume and CV tex documents are designed for use by someone in academia. 

You can find a working example of the templates at [rohitkgupta.com](http://rohitkgupta.com)

#### How to make a pdf vita from tex template
1. Download and install gummi / texmaker.
2. Open either  - wildcard_type2.tex ,   wildcard_type2_cls  and helvetica.sty

> wildcard can be cv or resume depending on your need, templates for both are included

3. Fill in your information in .tex file. If you do not want any change in the design DO NOT change anything in .cls file.
4. Compile and save the pdf.
