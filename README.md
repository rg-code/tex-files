Latex Documents and templates

I have made some modifcation to meet my needs, all the templates are open source and contains the credit to original licesnes.
Please feel free to use and modify any of the cls and tex files by keeping the licensing info intact.

If you are using Debian based machine I recommend tex maker or gummi for editing tex documents.

> How to install gummi - ``` "sudo apt-get install gummi" ``` (Recommended)

> How to install texmaker for a debian machine - Download .deb file from [here](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html)

Both Resume and CV tex documents are designed for use by someone in academia. 

You can find a working example of the templates at [rohitkgupta.com](http://rohitkgupta.com)
